# Introduction

## Why is UK mandating RCR training?

*"As a public institution of higher education, public confidence in the responsible conduct of research (RCR) by faculty, staff and students is critical. We must promote and maintain a culture that is supported by an infrastructure that educates and assists in the ethical conduct of research."*

Lisa Cassis PhD, UK Vice President for Research (VPR)

------------------------------------------------------------------------

UK has had research misconduct cases in the past few years due to a failure of some researchers to follow Responsible Conduct of Research.

::: r-fit-text
This effects:

-   The reputation of UK and its researchers;
-   Researchers/research personnel affiliated with the wrongdoer;
-   Personnel managing the process for research misconduct;
-   Researchers doing honest work that could have received the research funding used;
-   General public if faulty data is used in publications is relied upon by the medical community, product development, etc.

## Areas of RCR Training at UK

-  **Mentoring**
-   Conflict of Interest
-   Peer Review

[Case Study #1](https://rwebmedia.ad.uky.edu/ORI/SecureContent/SecureContent/RCR_Cases/Safe_Work_Environment/Case_9/story.html)

## Discussion

::: r-fit-text
::: incremental
1.  What are the issues raised by this case?
2.  What should Nicole do? If her PI is unwilling to meet, is there anyone else she can contact to try and resolve the situation?
3.  What are ways you can help prevent harassment in academia?

# Case Study Two

## Mentoring / Data Management

In this session, learners will consider research misconduct, consider how stress in the workplace can contribute to poor ethical conduct, and learn about available University resources.

::: r-fit-text
Through this case, learners will:

-   examine research misconduct
-   learn about university resources to manage work-life stressors
:::

[Case Study #2](https://rwebmedia.ad.uky.edu/ORI/RCR_Cases/Data_Cherry_Picking/index.html)

## Discussion

::: incremental
1.  What pressures are being faced by the postdoc?
2.  How might those pressures change how he conducts his research?
3.  What could the PD have done before the data analysis stage to help prevent this situation?
4.  Discuss the PD’s assertion that the data is “good enough for the grant application.”
5.  What ethical issues are raised if misleading data is presented in a grant application?
6.  How do you balance work/home life? Should you be able to discuss these expectations with the PI?
7.  What major mistake did the PD make when he deleted all the negative Western blots?
8.  What would you do if you were in the PD’s position?
:::

::: notes
Additional prompts: - How would you have handled the issues if you were the PD? - How do you avoid such issues in your own work? - What would you do if you were in the graduate student’s position and suspected your coworker was engaging in unethical data practices?

# Case Study Three

## Research Misconduct

In this session, learners will consider the discovery of research misconduct within their work environment, considerations for how to approach this issue, and methods for reporting misconduct at the University.

::: r-fit-text
Through this case, learners will:

-   learn about research misconduct
-   consider how to approach suspected research misconduct
-   learn how to report research misconduct
:::

[Case Study #3](https://rwebmedia.ad.uky.edu/ORI/SecureContent/SecureContent/RCR_Cases/Research_Misconduct/Case_2/index.html)

## Discussion

::: incremental
1.  Sum up the general problem under scrutiny.
2.  What should she do if she suspects research misconduct?
3.  With whom should she discuss the issue if the advisor/PI does not have a credible explanation?
4.  Are there reasonable explanations for the alleged data fabrication?
5.  Is there a designated person at UK that deals with such issues?
:::

::: notes
Additional prompts: - What would you do if you were in Prerna’s situation? - What would you do if you were a PI and this situation was brought before you by a new researcher or graduate student? - Have you ever encountered a similar situation? How did you handle it or how do you wish you would have handled it? - Is any one particular person at fault for the issue in this scenario if it was an instance of honest error or bad data management practices? - What corrective actions could the PI take to ensure this type of scenario does not occur again in the future?
