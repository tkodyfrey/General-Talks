# Introduction

## Why is UK mandating RCR training?

*"As a public institution of higher education, public confidence in the responsible conduct of research (RCR) by faculty, staff and students is critical. We must promote and maintain a culture that is supported by an infrastructure that educates and assists in the ethical conduct of research."*

Lisa Cassis PhD, UK Vice President for Research (VPR)

------------------------------------------------------------------------

UK has had research misconduct cases in the past few years due to a failure of some researchers to follow Responsible Conduct of Research.

::: r-fit-text
This effects:

-   The reputation of UK and its researchers;
-   Researchers/research personnel affiliated with the wrongdoer;
-   Personnel managing the process for research misconduct;
-   Researchers doing honest work that could have received the research funding used;
-   General public if faulty data is used in publications is relied upon by the medical community, product development, etc.

# Case Study One

## Research Misconduct

Let's talk plagiarism!

::: r-fit-text
Through this case, learners will:

-   learn about ethical issues with regard to plagiarism
-   learn about available plagiarism resources
-   consider ethical writing practices
:::

[Case Study #1](https://rwebmedia.ad.uky.edu/ORI/RCR_Cases/I_wrote_it_why_rewrite_it/index.html)

## Discussion

::: r-fit-text
::: incremental
1.  Sum up the general problem under scrutiny.
2.  What aspects of the scenario stood out the most to the group?
3.  Was the graduate student right to be concerned about this practice?
4.  What do you think of the post-doc's explanation for why he reused old papers?
5.  What might happen if the PI does not change the text before publication?
6.  What do you think of GS' decision to not talk to anyone about her concerns?
7.  What could happen is she does pursue this line of questioning?
8.  What would you do in her place?

::: notes
Additional prompts: - How would you address suspected plagiarism in your workplace? - If you suspected someone of engaging in self-plagiarism, would you address the issue the same as you would with plagiarism of someone else's work? Why or why not?

# Case Study Two

## Peer Review

In this session, learners will consider misconduct during the peer review process.

::: r-fit-text
Through this case, learners will:

-   learn about ethical conduct related to the peer review process
:::

[Case Study #2](https://rwebmedia.ad.uky.edu/ORI/SecureContent/SecureContent/RCR_Cases/Peer_Review/Case_1/index.html)

## Discussion

::: r-fit-text
::: incremental
1.  What are the issues raised by this case?
2.  What are the rules for serving as a reviewer of grant proposals? How can those rules be enforced?
3.  Should proposals be reviewed by people who do not work in your field? Why or why not?
4.  Can we ensure that reviewers do not gain an unfair advantage when conducting research and competing for funding when they get to read other researcher’s confidential and innovative proposals? If so, how?
5.  Under what circumstances would you file a complaint? What are the pros and cons of reporting such theft as a form of misconduct? To whom should the complaint be reported?
6.  Have you ever had anyone steal one of your research ideas? How did you deal with it, and what lessons did you learn?

::: notes
Additional prompts: -   What are Stephanie’s options for dealing with the situation? -    Was Stephanie at fault for taking longer to publish due to her desire to get a more extensive manuscript published and should have just published all her finding separately?
