# Introduction

Going to start by answering some key questions:

-   Why is this necessary?
-   Who made this decision?
-   Who needs the training and when?

## Why is UK mandating RCR training?

*"As a public institution of higher education, public confidence in the responsible conduct of research (RCR) by faculty, staff and students is critical. We must promote and maintain a culture that is supported by an infrastructure that educates and assists in the ethical conduct of research."*

Lisa Cassis PhD, former UK Vice President for Research (VPR)

------------------------------------------------------------------------

UK has had research misconduct cases in the past few years due to a failure of some researchers to follow Responsible Conduct of Research.

::: r-fit-text
This effects:

-   The reputation of UK and its researchers;
-   Researchers/research personnel affiliated with the wrongdoer;
-   Personnel managing the process for research misconduct;
-   Researchers doing honest work that could have received the research funding used;
-   General public if faulty data is used in publications is relied upon by the medical community, product development, etc.

\*Then College of Medicine Dean Robert DiPaola was a co-author on one paper
:::

## Who made this decision?

"In an effort to ensure a baseline level of responsible conduct of research awareness and hopefully prevent research misconduct, a mandate of responsible conduct of research training was initiated based on a decision by a committee of representatives from several UK offices including offices under the VPR, the legal office, and the Dean for the College of Medicine at the time (current Provost).

## Who needs the training and when?

::: r-fit-text
All researchers and research-eligible UK personnel and graduate students are required to adhere to the RCR online course mandate in addition to the in-person training/discussion and it must be completed biennially.

Included in the mandate:

-   Full-time faculty
-   Staff
-   Graduate students (only have to complete the training once)
-   Trainees (undergraduates, postdoctoral fellows, visiting scientists)
-   Individuals supported in part or fully through research funding, grants and contracts.
:::

## What does the training include?

::: r-fit-text
1.  Online Training
    -   Individuals complete modules and associated quizzes through the CITI platform.
    -   Must be completed every 2 years by research-eligible individuals. \*Graduate students complete the components once unless joining a research project, grant, or sponsored project.
2.  In-person training / discussion
    -   One, one-hour session attended on Zoom or in-person on campus.
    -   Must be completed every 2 years.
:::

## Areas of RCR Training at UK

-   Discuss in groups
-   Summarize key points

*Must have minimum 1 hour of contact together*

# Case Study One

## Mentoring

In this session, learners will learn about self-plagiarism.

::: r-fit-text
Through this case, learners will:

1)  Learn about appropriate behavior with regards to mentoring
2)  Consider how to respond to safe work environment issues
3)  Learn how to report misconduct at the university
:::

[Case Study #1](https://rwebmedia.ad.uky.edu/ORI/SecureContent/SecureContent/RCR_Cases/Mentoring/Case_3/story.html)

## Discussion {.smaller}

::: incremental
1.  Sum up the general problem presented in the scenario. What issues can you identify?
2.  What are the responsibilities for both the mentor and mentee in developing a respectful and productive working relationship?
3.  What could Nicole do if her PI is unwilling to meet? Is there anyone else she can contact to try and resolve the situation?
4.  How can Dr. Sha create a more inclusive working environment?
5.  What are ways you can help promote a safe working environment?
:::

::: notes
• If you encounter a safe work environment issue at UK, who do you contact to report or discuss these issues? Do you think these issues are underreported? Why do you think that is? • What would you do if you were in Nicole’s situation? • What advice would you give to Dr. Sha about his mentoring approach? • Are you allowed to treat students differently in your mentoring approach? Is it ethical to do this? • Is it appropriate for Dr. Sha to comment on the students’ appearance? • Have you ever worked under someone with a mentoring or supervisory style you struggled with? How did you handle this? What advice would you offer to other mentors or students working in these conditions? • Do you think mentoring issues play a role in some research misconduct cases? Why do you think so?

# Case Study Three

## Safe Work Environment

In this session, learners will consider issues related to a safe working environment and how to address these concerns. Learners will review a brief case study and respond to questions related to the presented scenario.

::: r-fit-text
Through this case, learners will:

1)  Examine a scenario in which an employee no longer feels they have a safe working environment
2)  Consider how to approach such a scenario
3)  Learn about university resources related to the scenario
:::

[Case Study #3](https://rwebmedia.ad.uky.edu/ORI/SecureContent/SecureContent/RCR_Cases/Safe_Work_Environment/Case_2/index.html)

## Discussion

::: incremental
1.  Sum up the general problem presented in the scenario.
2.  What should Martha do?
3.  Do you think she is overreacting?
4.  Should she discuss her discomfort with her supervisor? If so should she do it one-on-one or have a neutral third party be present as well?
:::

::: notes
What would you do if you found yourself in Martha’s position? • Do you think it was appropriate for Martha’s friend to tell her she was overreacting and dismiss her concerns? What advice would you have given Martha? • If you see someone engaging in unethical conduct at work (for example, an employee harassing another employee) do you have to report this issue at the university? If so, who do you report this to? Do you think these issues go underreported and if so, why do you think that happens? • How can Dr. Gilmore change his behavior to be more inclusive and create a safe work environment for his employees?
