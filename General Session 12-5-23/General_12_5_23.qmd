# Introduction

## Why is UK mandating RCR training?

*"As a public institution of higher education, public confidence in the responsible conduct of research (RCR) by faculty, staff and students is critical. We must promote and maintain a culture that is supported by an infrastructure that educates and assists in the ethical conduct of research."*

Lisa Cassis PhD, UK Vice President for Research (VPR)

------------------------------------------------------------------------

UK has had research misconduct cases in the past few years due to a failure of some researchers to follow Responsible Conduct of Research.

::: r-fit-text
This effects:

-   The reputation of UK and its researchers;
-   Researchers/research personnel affiliated with the wrongdoer;
-   Personnel managing the process for research misconduct;
-   Researchers doing honest work that could have received the research funding used;
-   General public if faulty data is used in publications is relied upon by the medical community, product development, etc.
:::

## Areas of RCR Training at UK

-   **Mentoring**
-   **Conflict of Interest**
-   Peer Review
-   **Research Misconduct**
-   Data Management
-   **Safe Work Environments**
-   Reproducibility

## What Will The Rest of the Day Look Like?

-   Observe 3 case studies
-   Discuss as a group
-   Summarize key points

*Must have minimum 1 hour of contact together*

# Case Study One

## Mentoring

In this session, learners will consider issues related to mentorship in research environments. Learners will view a brief case study video and participate in a group discussion and answer ethics-based reflection questions related to the presented scenario.

::: r-fit-text
Through this case, learners will:

-   Consider ethical approaches to mentoring.
-   Learn about resources related to the presented scenario.

## Discussion {.smaller}

::: incremental
1.  Sum up the general problem presented in the scenario.
2.  Who could the graduate students speak with about their issue? Do you know of any university resources that may help in this situation?
3.  Is there anything that could have been done to prevent the situation from arising? What could be done to prevent any future disruptions to the graduate student’s progress?
4.  What are the responsibilities for both the mentor and mentee in developing a respectful and productive working relationship?

:::

[Case Study #4](https://rwebmedia.ad.uky.edu/ORI/RCR_Cases/You_suspect_research_misconduct_now_what/index.html)

## Discussion {.smaller}

::: incremental
1.  Sum up the general problem presented in the scenario.
2.  What should the graduate student (GS) do in this situation?
3.  What are the possible outcomes?
4.  Are the possible benefits of remaining silent greater than the potential fallout if someone else figures out that research misconduct occurred?
5.  If you were in this situation, who would you talk to for advice or report your suspicions?
:::

::: notes
Additional prompts: What advice would you have given to the GS about her current situation? How would you handle the situation if it happened to you? Would your opinion change if the manuscript had been accepted by a high-impact journal?
