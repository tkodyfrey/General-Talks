# Introduction

## Why is UK mandating RCR training?

*"As a public institution of higher education, public confidence in the responsible conduct of research (RCR) by faculty, staff and students is critical. We must promote and maintain a culture that is supported by an infrastructure that educates and assists in the ethical conduct of research."*

Lisa Cassis PhD, UK Vice President for Research (VPR)

------------------------------------------------------------------------

UK has had research misconduct cases in the past few years due to a failure of some researchers to follow Responsible Conduct of Research.

::: r-fit-text
This effects:

-   The reputation of UK and its researchers;
-   Researchers/research personnel affiliated with the wrongdoer;
-   Personnel managing the process for research misconduct;
-   Researchers doing honest work that could have received the research funding used;
-   General public if faulty data is used in publications is relied upon by the medical community, product development, etc.
:::

## Areas of RCR Training at UK

-   **Mentoring**
-   Conflict of Interest
-   **Peer Review**
-   **Research Misconduct**
-   Data Management
-   Safe Work Environments
-   Reproducibility

## What Will The Rest of the Day Look Like?

-   Observe 3 case studies
-   Discuss in groups
-   Summarize key points

*Must have minimum 1 hour of contact together*

# Case Study One

## Peer Review

In this session, learners will consider the implication of unethical conduct in the peer review process.

::: r-fit-text
Through this case, learners will:

-   learn about ethical conduct during the peer-review process
-   learn how to manage conflicts of interest and bias related to the peer-review process
:::

[Case Study #1](https://rwebmedia.ad.uky.edu/ORI/SecureContent/SecureContent/RCR_Cases/Peer_Review/Case_3/story.html)

## Discussion {.smaller}

::: incremental
1.  Sum up the general problem presented in the scenario.
2.  Did Lisa act appropriately in telling Bill to publish quickly?
3.  Did Lisa act appropriately in delaying the review? In giving a critical and demanding review of the paper?
4.  Is there anything Lisa should have done differently when she received the submitted paper?
5.  Did Bill act unethically in this scenario? What should Bill have done when given the encouragement to publish?
:::

::: {.notes}
Additional prompts: Lisa clearly has a conflict of interest and chooses not to disclose this information. Should Lisa have excused herself from the review? Was Lisa acting fairly to the journal she agreed to help? Was Lisa acting fairly to the researchers that submitted their work for review? Was it ethical to take as long as she did to review the manuscript and then ask for major revisions? Did Lisa treat the manuscript as a confidential document? Did she demonstrate a breach in the confidentiality? Based on the feedback Lisa gave in the video, can we assume Lisa gave objective and unbiased feedback to the researchers? Do you think Lisa demonstrated any bias while performing her review duties?

# Case Study Two

## Research Misconduct 

In this session, learners will explore research misconduct.

::: r-fit-text
Through this case, learners will:

-   learn about research misconduct
-   learn about available resources regarding misconduct at the university
:::

[Case Study #2](https://rwebmedia.ad.uky.edu/ORI/RCR_Cases/You_suspect_research_misconduct_now_what/index.html)

## Discussion {.smaller}

::: incremental
1.  Sum up the general problem presented in the scenario.
2.  What should the graduate student (GS) do in this situation?
3.  What are the possible outcomes?
4.  Are the possible benefits of remaining silent greater than the potential fallout if someone else figures out that research misconduct occurred?
5.  If you were in this situation, who would you talk to for advice or report your suspicions?
:::

::: {.notes}
Additional prompts: What advice would you have given to the GS about her current situation? How would you handle the situation if it happened to you? Would your opinion change if the manuscript had been accepted by a high-impact journal?

# Case Study Three

## Mentoring / Safe Work Environment 

In this session, learners will learn about harassment and methods for reporting this misconduct at the University.

::: r-fit-text
Through this case, learners will:

-   learn about harassment
-   consider how to respond to harassment issues
-   learn how to report harassment at the University
:::

[Case Study #3](https://rwebmedia.ad.uky.edu/ORI/SecureContent/SecureContent/RCR_Cases/Safe_Work_Environment/Case_9/story.html)

## Discussion {.smaller}

::: incremental
1.  What are the issues raised by this case?
2.  What should Nicole do? If her PI is unwilling to meet, is there anyone else she can contact to try and resolve the situation?
3.  What are ways you can help prevent harassment in academia?
